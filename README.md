    <h5>Junior Information Systems major</h5>
    <p>I went home for a few days after New Year's. The city of Lithonia welcomed me with love and laughs. I went to see a friend who welcomed me with good vibes, and after an hour of catching up, he looked at me and said, "I'm proud of you. We're all proud of you." His statement made me smile, but it gave me more than a temporary feeling of happiness; it gave me motivation to do even more.</p>
    <p>I am from the small town of Lithonia, Georgia where most people don't make it out to quite honest. About 90% of my graduating class of 230 are still within the metro area. Some in local colleges. Some not. In high school, seniors would tape their college acceptance letters to their lockers. It was thing. As to say, "Guess how far I'm going," but it became more of a compettion of numbers and not substance. My peers would have 4 or 5 letters taped either proclaiming Georgia State, West Georgia, Valdosta, or UGA if you were in the gifted classes. I only had one letter taped to my locker: Howard University. I would catch people reading it during the bell period, and even though I wouldn't disrupt them while they read, I would think to myself, "I have to be great."</p>
