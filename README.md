    <p>I went home for a few days after New Year's. The city of Lithonia welcomed me with love and laughs. I went to see a friend who welcomed me with good vibes, and after an hour of catching up, he looked at me and said, "I'm proud of you. We're all proud of you." His statement made me smile, but it gave me more than a temporary feeling of happiness; it gave me motivation to do even more.</p>
